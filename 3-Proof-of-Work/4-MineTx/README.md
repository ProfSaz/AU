# Mine Blocks
This project is a local implementation of a blockchain structure, It includes functionalities to create blocks, mine them, and manage the blockchain's structure.

## Overview

The codebase consists of:

- **`index.js`**: Contains the core blockchain functionalities and structure.
- **`test.js`**: Test suite that validates the functionality of the blockchain.

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: Defines the essential blockchain functionalities such as mining blocks and managing the chain.
- `test.js`: Provides tests to verify the correctness of blockchain operations.

## Setup

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

3. Run test:
```shell
npm test
```

 ## Test Suite
The provided test suite in test.js validates the blockchain's functionalities:

### Mining Blocks:
Tests to ensure correct block creation and addition to the chain.
### Block Properties: 
Checks if blocks contain the expected properties like IDs.

## Credit 

This implementation is a local adaptation of concepts learned from Alchemy University's blockchain tutorial. The codebase is structured to demonstrate basic blockchain functionalities.
