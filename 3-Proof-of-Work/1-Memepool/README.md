# Mempool 

This project represents a local implementation of a blockchain structure. It encompasses functionalities to create, mine, and manage a basic blockchain.

## Overview

The project comprises:

- **`index.js`**: Core blockchain functionalities, including block creation and transaction management.
- **`test.js`**: Test suite ensuring the correctness of blockchain operations.

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: Defines the essential blockchain functionalities like transaction handling.
- `test.js`: Contains test cases validating blockchain functionality.

## Setup

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

3. Run test:
```shell
npm test
```
## Test Suite
The test suite `test.js` includes test cases to validate blockchain operations:

### Adding Transactions: 
Tests whether transactions are successfully added to the mempool.

## Credit 

This implementation is a local adaptation of concepts learned from Alchemy University's blockchain tutorial. The codebase is structured to demonstrate basic blockchain functionalities.
