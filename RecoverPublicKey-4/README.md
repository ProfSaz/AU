# Message Signing and Key Recovery

This repository contains an implementation of message signing and key recovery using JavaScript and the `@noble/secp256k1` library. This project was initially learned on Alchemy University and has been implemented for local use.

## Overview

The code in this repository demonstrates a process for signing a message with a private key and then recovering the corresponding public key. It utilizes the `@noble/secp256k1` library along with Chai for assertions.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Update the `PRIVATE_KEY` constant in the test file (`recoverKey.test.js`) with your desired private key.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the tests using `npm test` to verify the key recovery process.

## Disclaimer

This code is for educational purposes only and should not be used in production environments without proper understanding and security considerations.

## Credits

This implementation was learned from Alchemy University's platform and adapted for local use by Me.
