# What's in a Hash

This project is a local implementation of a blockchain  data structure, showcasing the concepts learned from Alchemy University. It includes a `Block` class with functionalities to generate a hash property.

## Overview
The project consists of:

`Block.js` The main module defining the Block class with a hash property generation functionality. 
`hashTest.js` Test suite validating the functionality of the Block class.


## Project Structure
`Block.js`  Implements the `Block` class with hash property generation.
`hashTest.js`Test suite to validate the correctness of the Block operations.


## Setup

```
### Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

### Run tests:

```shell
npm test
```

## Test Suite
The provided test suite in hashTest.js validates the Block class functionality:

*Hash Property Generation*
Ensures that the Block class correctly generates a hash property, adhering to the expected format.

## Credit
This local adaptation is based on the blockchain concepts learned from Alchemy University's tutorial. The codebase is structured to showcase the fundamental functionalities of a blockchain block.
