# What's in a Hash

This project is a local implementation of a blockchain data structure(What's in a Hash) block, demonstrating basic concepts learned from Alchemy University. It includes a Block class with functionalities to store random data and calculate its hash.

## Overview
The project consists of:

`Block.js` The main module defining the Block class with random data storage and hash calculation functionalities.
`blocSHAtest.js` Test suite validating the functionality of the Block class.

## Project Structure
`Block.js` Implements the Block class with random data storage and hash calculation.
`blockSHATest.js` Test suite to validate the correctness of Block operations.

## Setup
To run this project locally:

### Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone <repository-url> 
```
### Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

### Run tests:

```shell
npm test
```

## Test Suite
The provided test suite in blockSHATest.js validates the Block class functionalities:

*Store a Random Name*
Ensures the Block class correctly stores a random name and that the stored data matches the input.

*Hash Random Data*
Validates that the Block class calculates the hash of random data correctly.

## Credit
This local adaptation is based on the blockchain concepts learned from Alchemy University's tutorial. The codebase is structured to showcase the fundamental functionalities of a blockchain block.
