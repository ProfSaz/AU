# Genesis Block 

This project is a local implementation showcasing the creation of a blockchain with a genesis block. It reflects the concepts learned from Alchemy University.

## Overview

The project consists of:

`Block.js` Defines the structure and properties of a block in the blockchain.
`Blockchain.js` Implements the blockchain structure, including the creation of the genesis block.
`BlockchainTest.js` Test suite validating the existence and properties of the genesis block.

## Setup
To run this project locally:

### Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

### Run tests:

```shell
npm test
```
## Test Suite
The provided test suite in `BlockchainTest.js` validates the existence and properties of the genesis block:

*Genesis Block*
Ensures that the blockchain has a genesis block, and the block is of the correct type.

## Credit
This local adaptation is based on blockchain concepts learned from Alchemy University's tutorial. The codebase is structured to demonstrate the fundamental creation of a blockchain with a genesis block.
